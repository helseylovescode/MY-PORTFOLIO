                        Hello techies,<br> 
                        I’m Helsey. A software developer. I have a very interesting story about me.<br> 
                        It has always been my dream to become a software engineer especially since joining high school. I agree, that can be debatable, because I would always argue that it has been my childhood dream, thou the dream was not as lucid back then. My first love was being a pilot, of course that is every child’s dream at least but I would always love watching sci-fi movies and seeing lengthy lines of codes running through futuristic screens in some tech laboratories with blue light leaking in and be very infatuated by such. Over the years I have been cultivating my interest ever since by wanting to learn all there is about technology and its emerging trends.<br>
                        Fast forward, two years ago (2022), after finishing high school the dream was about to remain just a dream. My mother could not afford to fund my higher education in the university due to unfavorable conditions that came about after the introduction of a new university funding model in Kenya. It was even more difficult since my younger sister was joining high school. But all hope was not lost. Power Learn Project (PLP) came through just when I needed them. I saw their call for applications for individuals interested in learning software engineering and did not hesitate to make an application. Weeks later I received an email informing me that I had been accepted into their full scholarship program. It was so ecstatic. In 16 weeks’ time, I will be proud to call myself a software engineer, at least an entry level one.
                        It doesn’t stop there.<br> I am yet to learn a lot on my own and perfect on my skills.
